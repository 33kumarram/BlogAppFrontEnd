## Description

  BlogApp is a web application that allows users to write and publish their own articles, as well as read articles written by other users. The application is built using the React Js for the front-end, Node.js, Express.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database.

Users can sign up for an account using their email address and password. Once logged in, they can create new articles by providing a title, content, and optional tags to help categorize their post. Users can also edit or delete articles that they have previously published.

In addition to writing articles, users can also read articles written by other users. They can filter articles by category. Once they find an article they are interested in, they can read it in full and leave a comment to share their thoughts.

All of the features of BlogApp are available only to logged-in users, which helps to maintain the integrity of the content and foster a sense of community among users. User authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are generated upon successful login and used to authenticate subsequent requests to the server.

Overall, BlogApp provides a platform for writers and readers to connect and share their ideas and opinions in a secure and user-friendly environment.
